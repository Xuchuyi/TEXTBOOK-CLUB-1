### High-speed encouters

**Approximation condition**: The perturber $P$ has much larger initial velocity than the system $S$, so that  the time tidal force functions is much shorter than the dymical time of $S$  ==> the particle $q$ stays fixed when the tidal force is working.

(1) The impulsive tidal force results in the particle $q$ and $q$ gain energies
(2) the the internal kinematics of $S$ increases
(3) to keep virial equilibrium, $S$ undergoes a relaxation process. The increased energy is transferred to potential energy, which becomes less negative
(4) $S$ expands.

> tidal shocks due to high-speed encounters heat a collisionless system, which eventually results in expansion possibly associated with mass loss.


### Tidal stripping

*A more general case*

**Tidal radius**
- If this tidal acceleration exceeds the binding force per unit mass, the material will be stripped away from the subject mass.
- If the radius of a subject mass is larger than its tidal radius, it will experience mass loss due to tidal stripping.

**Tidal Streams and Tails**

- **Tidal Stripping of Satellite Galaxies**
	- the stripping of a relatively small satellite system orbiting in a larger host system
	- the stripped particles form a relatively thin structure in conﬁguration space, called a tidal stream or tidal tail. 

- **The Formation of Tidal Tails in Mergers** (disk galaxies)
	- if the encounter is prograde, then a test particle in the ring is in resonance with the tidal acceleration – it is continuously pulled either inwards or outwards, depending on its orbital phase. Consequently, the ring responds violently to the encounter. 
	- If, on the other hand, the encounter is retrograde, then test particles will be pulled alternatively inwards and outwards, with a high frequency, and the net effect of the tidal acceleration is small.

### Dynamical Friction

-  When an object moves through a large collisionless system whose constituent particles (the ﬁeld particles) have smaller masses,  the particles passing by are accelerated towards the object. 
- The particle number density behind the object is higher than that in front of it, and the net effect is a drag force (dynamical friction) on the object.
- It transfers energy and momentum from the subject mass to the ﬁeld particles.

**Orbital Decay**: a relatively massive object orbiting in a background host system to lose energy and angular momentum to the ‘ﬁeld’ particles of the host. Consequently, the orbit of the massive object decays with time, transporting it towards the center of the host’s potential well.  ==> Dynamical friction causes mass segregation, with more massive particles typically residing deeper in the potential well.


### Galaxy merging

**merger criterion**

 In principle, any bound orbit will eventually lead to a merger because the tidal interaction between the two galaxies always transfers orbital energy into internal energy.
 
 But if the angular momentum is high and if the orbital energy is not low enough, the merger will not happen in a Hubble time.

- mergers are only effective in systems with a velocity dispersion smaller than or comparable to the internal velocities of the orbiting galaxies. 
	- galaxy mergers can occur effectively in groups of galaxies, but not in rich clusters.
- for given orbital energy and angular momentum, mergers are expected to be more effective for more extended objects
	- When two such systems have an encounter, their extended halos may merge to form a common halo even if the two systems are on a mildly hyperbolic orbit.
	- galaxies orbit in a common halo until dynamical friction and tidal interactions have removed sufﬁcient orbital energy for the galaxies to merge.

**Merger Demographics**
When two systems merge, their orbital energy is transferred to the internal energy of the merger product.
Key properties:
- The progenitor mass ratio $q$. 
	- major mergers: violent relaxation plays an important role during the relaxation of the merger remnant, and the remnant typically has little resemblance to its progenitors.
	- minor merger: the remnant of a minor merger often resembles its most massive progenitor.
- Galactic disks 
	- fragile, and are therefore relatively easy to destroy, especially when $q$ is small.
	- Disks that accrete small satellites (i.e. in the minor merger regime with $q > 10$) typically survive the merger event but can undergo considerable thickening. 
	- mergers that involve one or more disk galaxies tend to create tidal tails, which are absent in mergers between two spheroids.
- The gas mass fractions of the progenitors.
	- Consequently, mergers between gas-rich progenitors (often called ‘wet’ mergers) can have a very different outcome from mergers between gas-poor progenitors (‘dry’ mergers).
- The orbital properties
	- determine the probability for a merger to occur
	- the relative orientation of the orbital spin with respect to the intrinsic spins of the progenitors (prograde or retrograde) is an important factor determining the prominence of tidal tails.

**Mergers, Starbursts and AGN**

- gas-rich disks show that the tidal perturbations can cause the disks to become globally unstable and to develop pronounced bars.
- The phase difference in the gaseous and stellar bars gives rise to torques that can effectively remove angular momentum from the gas.
 - The gas ﬂows towards the central region and eventually forms a dense gas concentration at the center of the merger remnant
- This gas may form stars at an extremely high rate, giving rise to a nuclear starburst. If some of the nuclear gas can continue to lose angular momentum, it may be able to fuel or even form a central black hole, resulting in an active galactic nucleus

Key questions:
- what fraction of the present-day stars formed in merger-induced starbursts  
- what is the role of feedback in regulating and terminating the starburst and AGN activity

**Minor merger and disk heating**

Heating of a galactic disk due to the accretion of a low mass satellite galaxy results in disk thickening
- Since the rotation curve of the disk–halo system is ﬂat, the velocity of the satellite does not change signiﬁcantly as it spirals towards the center. Hence, the change in the energy of the sinking satellite comes only from the change in potential energy.
- The energy the satellite loses will finally transfer to the potential energy of the disk, leading to the increase of the disk the disk scale height.
- disk thickening is more effective (i) for more massive satellites, (ii) at larger radii, (iii) for disks with a larger spin parameter (i.e. with a larger disk scale length and lower surface density), and (iv) for disks that are initially thinner (i.e. have a larger value of Rd/zd).
- Depending on the density and orbit of the satellite, the core of the satellite may survive the merger and sink towards the galactic center to form a bulge-like entity
- if it is tidally disrupted before it reaches the center, its stars may contribute to the stellar component of the (thickened) disk

Given that each of these subhalos may cause some amount of disk heating, this raises the question whether thin disks are expected to survive in a CDM cosmology. If the total heating rate due to the cumulative effect of the entire population of subhalos expected in the host halo of a disk galaxy is large, the ubiquity of observed thin disks may indicate a serious problem for the CDM paradigm.

### Transformation of Galaxies in Clusters

**Galaxy Harassment**

high-speed encounter case

- the perturbed galaxy becomes less bound, and more vulnerable to disruptions by further encounters and by tidal interactions with the global cluster potential.
- If disk galaxies experience several close encounters with relatively massive cluster members, they may lose very substantial amounts of mass as impulsive heating pushes stars onto unbound orbits. The disk stars that remain bound to the galaxy are also heated, causing a transformation of the (dynamically cold) disk into a spheroidal component closely resembling a dwarf elliptical.


**Galactic Cannibalism**

dynamical friction case 

Because of dynamical friction, galaxies lose energy and momentum which causes them to ‘sink’ towards the center of the potential well. A central cluster galaxy may accrete satellite galaxies.

- it causes the central galaxy to increase in mass, and it causes a depletion of massive satellite galaxies, for which the dynamical friction time is the shortest. Consequently, cannibalism causes an increase of the magnitude difference, ΔM12 , between the brightest and second brightest member of a cluster. If galactic cannibalism is the main mechanism regulating the luminosity of the central galaxy, the magnitude gap ΔM12 can thus be used as a measure for the dynamical age of the cluster: older systems will have a larger magnitude gap.
- the central cluster galaxy is typically also the brightest cluster galaxy and often has an extraordinarily diffuse and extended outer envelope, in which case it is called a cD galaxy.  This would explain not only their large masses, but also their diffuse envelopes, which, in this picture, consist of material tidally stripped from the cannibalized galaxies as they spiral into the cluster center.

**Ram-Pressure Stripping**

When a galaxy moves through the intracluster medium (ICM), its gas component experiences a ram pressure, just like one feels wind drag when cycling.

The ram-pressure stripping discussed above may strip a galaxy of its entire cold gas reservoir, causing an abrupt quenching of its star formation.
